        Award-winning creativity
      %p
        Stef has won a clutch of awards for his creative work, and took to photography out of the love of making beautiful images. 
      %p
        When his parter, Emily Quinton's wedding business took off he found himself increasingly being involved as 'second shooter' at the larger weddings she was asked to photograph. It seemed to come naturally!
            
      %p
        Stef is represented by 
        %a{:href=>"http://emilyquinton.com"}

      %h1
        Philosophy?
        %br
        It's all about capturing the spirit of the event.

      %p
        You'll hear people talking about 'reportage' and 'vintage' as what's currently in fashion, but the real thing that matters is that the feeling of the big day is captured for posterity. 
        
      %p
        That's what Stef focusses on. Sometimes it's the little details that do it, sometimes it's an unexpected joke between friends, a teary eye or a look from father to daughter. 

      %p
        Stef tries to be there, anticipating when these small, fleeting things happen and to open and close the camera shutter just in time.
